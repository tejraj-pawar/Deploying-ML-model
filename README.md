# Deploying-ML-model
In this we'll create simple ML model and deploy it using Flask api's

* First, run model.py file, which will create ML model and saved it on disk.
* Take a look at index.html file placed inside templates folder.
* Now, run app.py file and go to browser "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" and fill house details and it will predict house price.
* There is another way also, i.e. by providing input to ML model through JSON. for this run request.py

NOTE: Housing.csv is too short and it is made by me for learning purpose only.
